# Atomic Mass Calculator

## Overview

This Python script serves as a tool to calculate the average atomic mass based on user-input isotopes and their abundances. The script is designed to be straightforward and educational, making it an excellent resource for those learning about atomic masses in a chemistry or physics context.

## Instructions

1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. Follow the prompts to input the atomic masses and abundances for three isotopes.
3. The script will then compute and display the average atomic mass.

## Example

```bash
$ python atomic_mass_calculator.py
Enter 3 isotopes here:
Isotope 1: 12.01
Isotope 2: 14.01
Isotope 3: 16.00

Enter abundance in decimal form for each isotope below:
Abundance 1: 0.5
Abundance 2: 0.3
Abundance 3: 0.2

The Average Atomic Mass is... 13.31
